                <p>The majority of people will advise a web designer over a front-end developer when given a choice between the two. Why? Because these two professions might seem similar to an audience without technical knowledge, there are some differences
                    between web designer and front end developer. Between web designer vs front end developer, for any customer, a web designer develops a complete visual identity and online presence, including a webpage, logo, print and digital media,
                    branding, swag, and much more. To establish a unified branding and visual package, designs are fluid across all forms of media. Whereas a web designer considers user experience from a visual standpoint, a front-end developer considers
                    user experience and visual presentation but keeps the priority and approach focused on the code itself. They can do some graphic stuff, but not on the level of a designer. While they may occasionally design logos, their core power
                    is in coding. And if you are good at coding or perhaps love it, check out the online Front-end Bootcamp to learn from the best. </p>

                <h4>Web Design vs Front end Development: Similar But Not Identical!</h4>
                <p>A web designer vs front end developer both build websites, but a web designer concentrates their skills on the visual aspect, those clues that entice you to explore deeper. A designer is unconcerned with coding and does not think about
                    CSS, JavaScript, or PHP. Instead, they think in terms of visuals and how to entice the audience to go more. A designer is someone who thinks in terms of texture, proportion, color, and geometry. There are other popular terms like border-radius,
                    background-image, float, and flexbox used by front-end developers. Although web developers and front-end developers are subsets of the same discipline, they differ in a few ways. Their attention to the browsing experience and visual
                    design skills might set them apart. The differences between web design and front-end development vary on many different parameters. Those intrigued and interested in web development, whether web designing or programming, can join Web
                    Development courses online with certificates to kick-start their careers. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Web developers can be categorized into three groups based on their roles</h4>
                <p><b>Front-end developers:</b> The front end of a website is the area with which the visitor interacts directly. The phrase "client-side" of the application is also used to describe it. Some languages essential for front-end development
                    are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Front-end developers are responsible for implementing the framework, style, functionality, and composition of everything displayed on the screen when creating websites, online programs, or phone applications.
                    The two key goals of the front-end developers are response and performance. <br><b>Back-end developers:</b> A back-end developer is in charge of the website's most obscure but critical part. The back end of a website is the server-side
                    programming used to design the webpage. It saves and organizes data while ensuring that everything on the user side of the webpage functions correctly. Back-end operations involve developing APIs, building libraries, and interacting
                    with a part of the system without user interface design or even scientific programming systems.<br><b>Full-stack developers:</b> Full-stack web developers are capable of creating comprehensive websites and web-based applications. They
                    specialize in web applications or websites' front, back-end, databases, and debugging. One can opt for the best course for Full-stack Developers to easily learn in depth about full-stack. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>How are They Similar?</h4>
                <p>Web designer and front-end developer job descriptions involve many differences. Everyone knows that, right? However, there are some parallels too between the two professions. The web designer and front-end developer are both problem solvers.
                    They are both concerned with the user experience as well as the look and feel of the website. However, they address the problems in opposite ways; one through graphics while the other uses code. Tip: Pair up a designer and a front-end
                    developer to maximize their core strengths and capitalize on their skills for the benefit of your clients. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>What Should You Choose Between Web Developers vs Front-End Developers? Which One Is Right for You? </h4>
                <p>A website or application's overall design starts from conception to implementation. Every aspect must be understood prior to becoming a web designer and a front-end developer. Examining ideas connected to digital media might help you enter
                    one of these roles, regardless of whether you're fascinated by the user experience or the behind-the-scenes action. Find out how KnowledgeHut’s online Front-end Bootcamp can get you started on the road to building websites and other
                    web-based apps that are such a vital part of our daily lives. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>A web designer creates a website's aesthetic appeal, but a front-end developer ensures that consumers have the best possible experience. Website splendor and usability are the major topics that web designers discuss. Web designers' primary
                    duty is to concentrate on the overall look and feel of the website by utilizing various programs like Photoshop and Corel Draw to make the website more appealing. The front-end developer's job may involve developing interactive tools
                    and perhaps other elements that enhance the application or website to make it more user-friendly or entertaining to use. These techies concentrate on making the application or website aesthetically beautiful and ensuring that it operates
                    properly for their consumers. </p><br><br>

            <h1>Responsive Web Design Tutorial and Best Practices</h1>

                <p>Mobile revolution that started a decade ago not only changed the way we interact with products but also changed the way we design products. The first iPhone was a powerful computer that combined three things —phone, music player, and internet
                    browser. The latter had a tremendous impact on the web industry because designers had to adapt websites for small-size screens. And the situation got more complex when other hardware manufacturers rushed to adapt to even more niche
                    mobile devices. As a result, designers who worked on web designs had to adapt the website not only for various desktop resolutions but also for many different mobile devices. It quickly became evident that creating a separate version
                    of the site for each resolution and new device was impractical. Design industry needed a new approach for web design that would be flexible enough to support various types of screens and resolutions. That approach is called responsive
                    design, and it represents a fundamental shift in how we build websites. In this article, I want to share foundational rules that will help you deliver a quality experience, no matter how large or small the display size your users will
                    have.
                </p><br>
                <h4>What is responsive design?</h4>
                <p>Responsive web design is an approach that allows design across various devices (mobile, desktop, tablet, etc.) and suggests design should respond to the user’s behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation. Flexible grids are
                    foundational elements of responsive design. All assets such as images adapt to various screen sizes & resolutions (using CSS media queries). As a result, the user has great UX no matter what device they use—whether it’s a large desktop
                    or small screen of mobile device, the website automatically switch to accommodate for resolution. In 2010, Ethan Marcotte wrote an introductory article about the approach, Responsive Web Design, for A List Apart. Here is a great quote
                    from Ethan: “Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web devices, we can treat them as facets of the same experience. We can design for an optimal viewing experience, but embed standards-based
                    technologies into our designs to make them not only more flexible, but more adaptive to the media that renders them.”</p><br>
                <h4>Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile First</h4>
                <p>In the world of web design, we have a few terms that describe the process of design optimization for various screens— responsive, adaptive and mobile-first designs. You may wonder what exactly is the difference between all of them? Responsive
                    and adaptive web design are closely related, but there are some differences between them. Responsive web design uses CSS media queries to dynamically change the page layout based on the target device such as display type, width, height,
                    etc. Adaptive design, on the other hand, uses static layouts based on breakpoints that don’t respond once they’re loaded. As you can see, adaptive design is a less flexible solution for the problem of design optimizations for various
                    screens. “Mobile-first” is a conceptual term. As the name suggests, mobile-first means that web designers start the product design from the mobile medium and then design tablet, desktop, and monitors. “Mobile first” way of thinking
                    for design helps product teams to focus on the most important content and deliver it to users.</p><br>
                <h4>The nature of responsive design</h4>
                <p>Some people think that responsive web design is all about fitting design to various screen resolutions. That’s not entirely true. Responsive design represents a whole new way of thinking about design. It’s about creating flexible design
                    solutions. To represent responsive design, Josh Clark, memorably adapted the famous Bruce Lee quote Be Water, My Friend when he coined content is like water. What does this mean? If you think of your content as water and pour it from
                    one device to another – the water remains the same, but the view of the water is changed per device. And you can have more water than a device can handle, meaning you will need to optimize content per device. Responsive design is based
                    on the idea of “flexible everything”—not only the layout, but the content itself should be aligned to the medium.</p><br>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Responsive web design tools enable designers to maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple devices. No matter what device a person is using, they always will have content optimized for this medium.</p>
